# ðŸ’¡Pedestrian Path Recommendation Based on Safety Index

## ðŸŒŸOverview

This project aims to develop a system for recommending pedestrian paths based on safety indices.  
It involves analyzing various factors that contribute to pedestrian safety and utilizing this data to suggest the safest walking routes.

## ðŸ“˜Features

- **Safety Index Calculation**: Calculate a safety score for different paths based on factors such as street lighting, pavement quality, traffic volume, and historical accident data.
- **Path Recommendation Algorithm**: Algorithms to analyze safety data and recommend the safest pedestrian paths.
- **Interactive Map Integration**: Integration with mapping services to visualize recommended paths.
- **Real-Time Data Utilization**: Ability to process real-time data to update safety indices and path recommendations.

## ðŸ“˜Project Structure

- `data_collection/`: Scripts for collecting safety-related data.
- `path_analysis/`: Algorithms for analyzing pedestrian paths and calculating safety indices.
- `web_app/`: Front-end web application for user interaction.
- `api/`: Backend API for handling data processing and path recommendation logic.
- `database/`: Database schemas and scripts for storing safety data and user queries.
